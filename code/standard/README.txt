Proposal of standards to be used beyond the Kleros project to allow interoperability between other dapps.

RNGStandard.sol proposes a standard for random number generating contracts.
RNGBlockhash.sol implements it using the simplest method of using the blockhash (not that it can be manipulated by miners not publishing blocks).
TrustedRNG.sol implements a random number generator based on a trusted third party.

ArbitrationStandard.sol proposes a standard for Arbitrable and Arbitrator contracts.
